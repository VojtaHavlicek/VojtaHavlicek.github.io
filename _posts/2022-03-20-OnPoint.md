In the process of learning Unity, I created a simple game that I called ON POINT. Try it out below! 
I will try to make it available on your phone soon.

<canvas id="unity-canvas" style="width: 600px; height: 400px; background: #231F20"></canvas>
<script src="../onpoint-webgl/Build/onpoint.loader.js"></script>
<script>
      createUnityInstance(document.querySelector("#unity-canvas"), {
        dataUrl: "Build/onpoint.data",
        frameworkUrl: "Build/onpoint.framework.js",
        codeUrl: "Build/onpoint.wasm",
        streamingAssetsUrl: "StreamingAssets",
        companyName: "Vojta",
        productName: "OnPoint",
        productVersion: "0.42",
      });
</script>
