## About

Hi, I am Vojta. Welcome to my website. I will be publishing stuff that I create whenever I like. If you enjoy it, let me know. 

## On Point
On Point is a simple game that I made to learn Unity. I used to program games in Flash long time ago and it seems that it took just 10 years to revive it. Try it below and let me know how you like it!
